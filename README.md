# CaledoniaCapstone
Caledonia is a full Java app built using the JavaFX framework. It is a game prototype inspired by games like Slay the Spire, where the player uses a deck of cards to take on an escalating series of challenges.
It was built over the course of two weeks by a team of two people as the capstone project for a 16 week software development course.

Features -
Players have a randomly generated deck of cards that they can use to fight enemies. Each turn, the enemy fights back.
When an enemy is defeated, the player collects their treasure and a new card from a set of randomly generated reward cards to add to their deck.
The player finds some respite in treasure rooms where they can heal, move cards between their deck and a bag, and collect more rewards.
Enemies and card rewards both increase in strength as the game goes on.
If the player falls to 0 health, they die and must restart the game.
If the player manages to reach and defeat the boss, they win and have the option to start a new game plus where enemies and rewards continue to scale.

My Contribution -
I created the initial concept for Caledonia and did a lot of the initial planning. I learned JavaFX from scratch for this project, and built the entire GUI and frontend.
I learned and implemented the MVVM pattern, which defined the frontend architecture.
I worked on some of the backend code, integrating things neccessary for frontend functionality into the basic game objects and logic, as well as working with my partner to develop how the backend should be structured.
I used photoshop to create the game assets out of freely available asset packs, learning how to work with tilesets and how to create gifs.

Technology -
This app is built entirely using Java and the JavaFX framework.
